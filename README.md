# TalkEase_AI

This project presents a novel system to bridge communication barriers for individuals with physical disabilities. The system enables real-time text-to-speech conversion and sign language translation by integrating Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), pyttsx3, OpenCV, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This innovative approach facilitates effective communication by transforming spoken language into visual cues, empowering individuals with speech impairments to interact more seamlessly with the world around them.
